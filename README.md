# AI Assistant with MCP Servers, LangChain & Groq

A multi-tool, agentic AI assistant powered by [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/anthropics/model-context-protocol), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and [Groq](https://groq.com/). This assistant dynamically connects to external tools and services like web search (DuckDuckGo), browser automation (Playwright), and travel APIs (Airbnb) ‚Äî all without writing separate integration code for each tool.

> Built from scratch using `mcp-use`, LangChain, and Cursor IDE. Ideal for AI agents, autonomous task execution, and context-aware assistants.
